Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, I began pursuing a career in journalism in high school when I co-founded and led a fashion and culture magazine that published three in-print issues and created a space for young women to express their creativity. Since then, I have continued to expand my portfolio and strengthen communication and writing abilities as social media intern for the Prison Within documentary and, most recently, as editorial intern for Flaunt Magazine where I was published over 30 times and became the fastest intern to get published in print.
